# Introduction

## Why develop this plugin when Photoshop already includes Banana?
*	Google provides developers with $300 in free cloud credits, making it practical to evaluate and integrate advanced models.
*	This plugin enables direct integration of ByteDance SeeDream 4.5 into Photoshop, with the first 400 generations available at no cost.
*	Banana already delivers sufficient generation quality, eliminating the need to run local ComfyUI or Stable Diffusion pipelines, which reduces setup complexity and resource usage.

## Compatibility
